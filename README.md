# Kerr-Coupled-QRC-supplementary
---
This repository contains some supplemetary work in the coupled Kerr QRC project which are not discussed in the paper such as algorithmic hyperparameter optimization, delay effect analysis, and data anlysis of MG series results.

*This is the README for a repository with the name **Kerr-Coupled-QRC-supplementary**, which will be public soon.
---
This repository is structured as follows:
- [finalDA](https://github.com/alikauc/Kerr-Coupled-QRC-supplementary/tree/main/finalDA) contains codes for data generation (QRC) and analysis of the MG series task, which includes data analysis techniques such as model fitting, outlier analysis, binned analysis, and correlation coefficient.
- [Delay effect](https://github.com/alikauc/Kerr-Coupled-QRC-supplementary/tree/main/delay_effect) contains the data (and the codes for generating those data) for assessing the effects of delay in the task (for how long in the future the model should predict the data?) on the performance of the model and entanglement advantage.
